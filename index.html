      Over the course of human history, science has developed<br>
      from our<br>
      early understanding of fire, wind, water and earth to<br>
      exploring every<br>
      thing from galaxies far away to the very building blocks<br>
      of life itself.

      Explore the wonders of our<br>
      cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition,<br>
      ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the<br>
      night sky and what we can see and<br>
      know about the universe around<br>
      us. We’ll locate the various<br>
      constellations and galaxies that can<br>
      be seen and learn a bit about the<br>
      early navigators who used the stars<br>
      to travel by
